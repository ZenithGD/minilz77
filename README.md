# MiniLZ77

Tiny implementation of the LZ77 compression algorithm, written in Rust

---

## Task
The main task is to implement LZ77 in a memory efficient language. The algorithm
has to be evaluated against a collection of documents (i.e [project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org)). 
The performance should be compared to other compression tools, such as `gzip` or `bzip2`.

## Motivation
This is a university assignment, but it's also a personal project for learning to code in Rust.
